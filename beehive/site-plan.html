        Bees are one of the most pinnacle foundations of the world we live in today. As pollinators, they are responsible for the health and productivity of all flowering plants. The plants include many of the fruits and vegetables we have become so accustomed to having every day.
Although no one knowingly would want bees to go extinct, there are many things that we gladly participate in that are either directly or indirectly harming bee populations. You may think to yourself “I am not a farmer or some big business, what could I be doing to harm bees?” The answer may surprise you.
Do you have a small garden in your backyard and use pesticides to keep annoying pests away from your tomatoes? Do you drive an inefficient vehicle to and from work and everywhere around town? These may seem like insignificant things to you, but when you take into account the number of people who do the same, the numbers and effects build up quickly. With large numbers of people, the amount of air pollution from motor vehicles and chemicals from pesticides and herbicides have created a hazardous environment for bees and have significantly affected their ability to reproduce and thrive.
Read on to learn more about the important role bees play in our lives and what small but powerful steps we can take to make a difference for the bees!

      <h3>Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Why are bees so important? What can those tiny little things do that is so significant? These are common, understandable questions. The answer lies in their design. Honeybees are what we call pollinators. Pollinators play the role of fertilizers for flowering plants, spreading pollen from plant to plant allowing for seeds to be made and new plants to be grown. Understanding the role bees fulfill demonstrates just how irreplaceable they are in nature. 
Bees pollinate a lot of fruits and vegetables that we eat every day. Some of the fruits include apples, watermelons, cantaloupe, blueberries, and peaches. Some of the vegetables include asparagus, broccoli, carrots, onions, and celery. Could you imagine going through life without these common pieces of our daily diets? 
About one-third of the food eaten by Americans comes from crops pollinated by honeybees. With their steady decrease in population, it is becoming harder and harder to provide these crops to meet demand. It is possible that in the very near future we will have to say goodbye to all off these fruits and vegetables that we have taken for granted. It is not too late however; we can turn the tide and make a real effort to preserve this irreplaceable species and continue to enjoy the foods that keep us all healthy.

      <h3>Rescue Plan</h3>
      <p>
        So right about now you are probably wondering what the next step is. "What should I do to save Honeybees?" Luckily, there are some very simple things that can be done to make a huge difference. The first and most obvious would be to stop using any form of pesticide or herbicide. These artificial chemicals are extremely poisonous to honeybees and are the main cause for their extreme decline. Your garden may not be as beautiful as it could be, but the entire world will thank you for your sacrifice. The next thing actually is even more simple. Like all other creatures, they need to drink water.
        Getting a small bird bath from your local supply store and adding small rocks to serve as platforms for the bees to rest on is a wonderful way to help the bees do the work we need them to do. Creating a safe environment for bees is key in ensuring that they not only survive but thrive in the wild. Some other things that anyone can do are donating to bee farms, planting flowers, or simply even avoiding swatting them!
If everyone who visits this site and learns about the dire need for honeybees takes these small steps towards saving them, a real difference can be made. Together we can help bees make the recovery they need and preserve the delicious fruits and vegetables we all love so much. The underestimated most important step to all of this is… talk! Share this knowledge and these ideas with your family, friends, neighbors… anyone who will listen! This only works if we all work together, so speak up!
Save the Bees!
