                    Bees are one of the most pinnacle foundations of the world we live in today. 
                    As pollinators, they are responsible for the health and productivity of all flowering plants. 
                    The plants include many of the fruits and vegetables we have become so accustomed to having every day. 
                    Although no one knowingly would want bees to go extinct, there are many things that we gladly participate 
                    in that are either directly or indirectly harming bee populations.

                    You may think to yourself “I am not a farmer or some big business, what could I be doing to 
                    harm bees?” The answer may surprise you. Do you have a small garden in your backyard and use 
                    pesticides to keep annoying pests away from your tomatoes? Do you drive an inefficient vehicle 
                    to and from work and everywhere around town? These may seem like insignificant things to you, 
                    but when you take into account the number of people who do the same, the numbers and effects 
                    build up quickly. With large numbers of people, the amount of air pollution from motor vehicles 
                    and chemicals from pesticides and herbicides have created a hazardous environment for bees and 
                    have significantly affected their ability to reproduce and thrive. Read on to learn more about 
                    the important role bees play in our lives and what small but powerful steps we can take to 
                    make a difference for the bees!
