                    So right about now you are probably wondering what the next step is. 
                    "What should I do to save Honeybees?" Luckily, there are some very simple 
                    things that can be done to make a huge difference.

                    The first and most obvious would be to stop using any form of pesticide or herbicide. 
                    These artificial chemicals are extremely poisonous to honeybees and are the main cause 
                    for their extreme decline. Your garden may not be as beautiful as it could be, but the 
                    entire world will thank you for your sacrifice.

                    The next thing actually is even more simple. Like all other creatures, they need to 
                    drink water. Getting a small bird bath from your local supply store and adding small 
                    rocks to serve as platforms for the bees to rest on is a wonderful way to help the bees 
                    do the work we need them to do. Creating a safe environment for bees is key in ensuring 
                    that they not only survive but thrive in the wild.

                    Some other things that anyone can do are donating to bee farms, planting flowers, 
                    or simply even avoiding swatting them! If everyone who visits this site and learns 
                    about the dire need for honeybees takes these small steps towards saving them, a real 
                    difference can be made. Together we can help bees make the recovery they need and 
                    preserve the delicious fruits and vegetables we all love so much. The underestimated 
                    most important step to all of this is… talk! Share this knowledge and these ideas with 
                    your family, friends, neighbors… anyone who will listen! This only works if we all work 
                    together, so speak up! Save the Bees!
