    <h2>Nicholas Howard</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Nicholas Howard and I am a student currently pursueing a bachelors of Computer Science.
        I am from Lebanon, Ohio, a small town outside of Dayton and about 30 minutes north of Cincinnati. My hobbies include tinkering with any and everything around me.
        I grew up in a family of 6, with one older sister and two younger brothers. My older sister has graduated from BYU-I with a degree in graphical design and one of my
        brothers and I are current students here.
    </p>
    <p> I really love BYU-I for its amazing online classes. They have allowed me to complete my education from wherever I have been.
        Learning about web design is not neccesarily the main focus of my major, however learning how to build and design websites will expand my knowledge of computer 
        code and expand my opporunities within the carreer path I choose.
    </p>
    <p>
        I look forward to working along side and getting to know all of you throughout the semester! Good Luck!
    </p>
